# RefactoringCodebaseAccesibility

## Description

Made a website more accessable to anyone that may use it. 
Changes a handful of div's to more specific classes. 
This will alow the HTML to be read more clear and concisely from top to bottom. 
I did this so that any persons that are using a screen reader will also gewt a clear and concise discription. 
Making these changes showed me that "div" can always be brocken down into more specific classes. Also, background images are not classed the same as other images.   

HTML changes
Created header from div's
Moved Header out of the body.
Added alt text to images
created sections from div's
created asides from div's
created footer from div's

CSS changes
Combined .benfit-lead, .benifit brand and benefit cost to one line just to make it more concise. 
Combined search engine optimization, onmline reputation managment and sociol media marketing to one line to make more concise.  
Items were the same exact perameters so they could sit in the same line.
